# Pong-in-JAVA
This is a simple pong game made with swing in java. I tried to make it very close to the original 

## Description
This is simple 2 player atari game which uses WASD for the left side and the arrow keys for the right side. A **game loop/cycle** has been implemented to make the movement of the player controled paddles along with the ball much more smooth. The **game loop/cycle** also reduces input delay/lag.
